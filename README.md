<h2>Description</h2>
The goal of this project is to study the factors that drive ideological change in social networks. Using an agent-based modeling approach, we model the political beliefs of individuals using beta distributions. Belief propagation is simulated through conversations, where "evidence" is sampled based on the conversation partner's beliefs and used to modify the posterior distribution of the participants. These conversations serve as the interactions between agents in large-scale social networks.

While condensing the complexity of political beliefs into a beta distribution is a large oversimplification, our results show that it is enough to generate complex social dynamics that emerge from the interactions between individuals. We were able to replicate real-world phenomena, like the formation of radical echo chambers, and the influence of news media in the beliefs of populations.
